# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Continue expanding test coverage to reach the 85% target. Focus on adding tests for the modules with the most uncovered lines: `ibkr_exec.py`, `backtest.py`, `permutation.py`, `correlation.py`, `cache.py`, `reporting.py`, and `selector.py`. After each module's tests are added, run the tests for that module only to ensure they pass and do not cause timeouts. After confirming success, proceed to the next module. Once all modules have been tested, rerun `docker compose build`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` to verify the build and capture logs in the `artifacts/` directory. Provide a valid evidence block with the required JSON structure, ensuring the coverage is at least 0.85 and listing all created artifacts.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.5,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.5 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
