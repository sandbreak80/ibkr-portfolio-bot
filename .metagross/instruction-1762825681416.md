# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

The agent must address the missing evidence block issue by ensuring that after expanding the test coverage, all required commands (`docker compose build`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test`) are executed and their logs are captured in the `artifacts/` directory. The agent should then provide a valid evidence block with the required JSON structure, ensuring the coverage is at least 0.85 and listing all created artifacts.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
