# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

To address the process timeout issue, break down the tasks into smaller, manageable parts. Focus on expanding test coverage by adding tests for uncovered modules and code paths. Resolve the remaining matplotlib-related test failures and ensure all linting style warnings are addressed. Once these tasks are completed, rerun `docker compose build`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` to verify the build and capture logs in the `artifacts/` directory. Provide a valid evidence block with the required JSON structure, ensuring the coverage is at least 0.85 and listing all created artifacts.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
