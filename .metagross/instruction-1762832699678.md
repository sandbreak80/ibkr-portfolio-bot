# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Continue expanding the test coverage to reach the 85% target. Focus on adding tests for uncovered modules and code paths. Address the remaining style warnings incrementally. After each set of tests is added, run `docker compose build`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` to verify the build and capture logs in the `artifacts/` directory. Ensure that the evidence block is correctly formatted and includes all required information, including a coverage value of at least 0.85 and a complete list of artifacts.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
