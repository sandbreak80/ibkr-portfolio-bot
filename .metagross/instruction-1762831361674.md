# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Investigate the cause of the cursor-agent exiting with code null. Check the logs for any error messages or stack traces that might indicate the source of the problem. Ensure that the Docker environment is correctly set up and that all dependencies are properly installed. Once the issue is identified and resolved, proceed with breaking down the test execution into smaller segments as previously instructed. Focus on expanding test coverage and resolving any matplotlib-related test failures. After each segment is tested successfully, rerun `docker compose build`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` to verify the build and capture logs in the `artifacts/` directory. Provide a valid evidence block with the required JSON structure, ensuring the coverage is at least 0.85 and listing all created artifacts.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
