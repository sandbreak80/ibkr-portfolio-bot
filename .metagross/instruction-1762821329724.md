# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Proceed with Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure. Start by setting up the Docker environment, including creating the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml. Then, create the Makefile with the specified targets. Ensure all configurations are aligned with the execution contract, and prepare the environment for subsequent phases.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
