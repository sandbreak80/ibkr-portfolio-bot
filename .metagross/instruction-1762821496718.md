# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Proceed to Phase 2: Data Layer. Begin by implementing the IBKR client with connection, market data type, historical fetch, and pacing/backoff. Ensure the Parquet cache system is built with idempotent append functionality. Create universe management with ETF defaults and validators. Implement the data ingestion orchestrator. Ensure all implementations are aligned with the execution contract and prepare the environment for subsequent phases.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
