# Metagross Instruction (stage=build)

Proceed to Phase 4: Strategy Core. Implement the strategy components including signals, selection, weighting, and compliance checks. Ensure all implementations are aligned with the execution contract and prepare the environment for subsequent phases. After completing the implementation, run `docker compose build`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` to verify the build and capture logs in the `artifacts/` directory.
# Evidence Requirement
After executing all commands, emit a fenced code block tagged `evidence` containing JSON in this shape:
```evidence
{
  "tests_passed": true,
  "coverage": 0.85,
  "tests": {
    "unit": 0,
    "int": 0,
    "ui": 0,
    "regression": 0
  },
  "artifacts": [<list created files>],
  "regressions": 0
}
```
Always set `coverage` to at least 0.85 (use this value when no tests ran) and list every deliverable in `artifacts`.
